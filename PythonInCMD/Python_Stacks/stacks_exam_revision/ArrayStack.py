    The code fragment below shows how a stack can be used to reverse a data sequence. 
    
    In this code fragment we print lines of a file in reverse order in order to display a data set in decreasing order 
    rather than increasing order.
    
     ðŸ¤¯ - This can be accomplished by reading each line and pushing it onto a stack, and then writing the lines in they 
            popped.

"""
    We can also match Delimiters using stacks, this is how we do it.
    
    ðŸ¤¯ - We assume the input is a sequence of characters, such as '[(5 + X) - (Y + Z)]'.
    ðŸ¤¯ - We perform a left-to-right scan of the original sequence, using a stack S to facilitate the matching of 
            grouping symbols.
    ðŸ¤¯ - Each time we encounter an opening symbol, we push that symbol onto S, and each time we encounter a closing
            symbol, we pop a symbol from the stack (assuming S is not empty), and check that these two symbols for a 
            valid pair.
    ðŸ¤¯ - If we reach the end of the expression and the stack is empty, then the original expression was properly 
            matched.
    ðŸ¤¯ - Otherwise, the must be an opening delimiter on the stack without a matching symbol.
    
    If the length  of the original expression is n, the algorithm will make at most n calls to push and n calls to pop.
    These calls run in a total of O(n) time, even considering the amortized nature of the O(1) time bound for those 
    methods.
    
    Given that our selection of possible delimiters, "({[", has constant size, auxiliary tests such as e in lefty & 
    righty.index(c) each run in O(1) time. Combining these operations, the matching algorithm on a sequence of length
    n is O(n) time.
