    ðŸ¤¯- stack = []: This line initializes an empty list named stack. In this context, the list represents a stack data
            structure where elements can be added to or removed from the top.

    ðŸ¤¯- stack.append(18), stack.append(11), stack.append(30): These lines add elements to the stack using the append()
            method. Each element is added to the top of the stack.

            method. The removed element is assigned to the variable popped_element.

    ðŸ¤¯- if __name__ == "__main__":: This line checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported
            as a module into another script). If it's being run directly, the main() function is called.

    ðŸ¤¯- main(): This line calls the main() function, which contains the code to manipulate the stack.
