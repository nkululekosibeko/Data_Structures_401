    How it works ?.
    
    Line (37 - 38) Check if the Queue is empty.
    ðŸ¤¯ - The method first checks if the queue is empty by calling the 'is_empty()' method.
    ðŸ¤¯ - If the Queue is empty, it raises an 'Empty' exception, indicating that the are no elements to dequeue.
    
    Line (39) Retrieve and Remove the front element.
    ðŸ¤¯ - If the queue is not empty, it retrieves the front element from the Queue, which is located at the index 
        'self._front' int the internal array '_data'.
    ðŸ¤¯ - This element is stored in the variable 'answer'.
    
    Line (40) Clear the front position
    ðŸ¤¯ - The front position is then set to 'None'.
    ðŸ¤¯ - This step helps to avoid loitering, which is the retention of references to objects that are no longer needed,
            Potentially leading to memory leaks.
            
    Line (41) Update the front index.
    ðŸ¤¯ - The front index is is updated to the next position.
    ðŸ¤¯ - This is done using modular arithmetic to ensure that the front index wraps around to the beginning of the array
            if it reaches the end.
    ðŸ¤¯ - The expression '(Self._front + 1) % len(self._data) ensures that 'self._front' stays within the bounds of the
        array.
        
    Line (42) Decrease the size
    ðŸ¤¯ - The size of the queue is decremented by 1 to reflect the removal of an element.

        Line (76 - 77) Check if the queue is full.
        ðŸ¤¯ - The method first if the queue is full by comparing the current size 'self._size' to the length of the 
                internal array 'len(self._data).
        ðŸ¤¯ - If the queue is full, it calls the '_resize' method to double the size of the internal array.

        Line (78) Calculate the available position.
        ðŸ¤¯ - The position where the new element will be added (avail) is calculated using the formula 
                '(self._front + self._size) % len(self._data)'.
        ðŸ¤¯ - This ensures that the new element is placed at the correct position, taking into account the circular 
                nature of the queue.
        ðŸ¤¯ - If the end of the array is reached, the position wraps around to the beginning.
        
        Line (79) Add the new element.
        ðŸ¤¯ - The new element e is placed at the calculated position (avail) in the internal array (_data).
